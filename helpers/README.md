helpers directory

This directory is for files of library functions used by your app. These are
placed in modules.

Initially this directory provides the Validation module for you, with various
helper methods for validating user inputs, e.g. email addresses and numbers.

You can add more helper modules by adding their files to this directory. Youâ€™ll
then need to create a file called my_helpers.rb in this directory, and use
include statements to ensure they are included (loaded) by the application.
