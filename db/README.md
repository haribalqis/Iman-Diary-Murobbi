db (Database) directory

This is where all files related to your database should live. Your schema (i.e.,
your CREATE TABLE SQL statements) should be written into the initially blank
schema.sql file. You may also put any data, in the form of SQL INSERT
statements into a file called data.sql, and these will be executed to populate
tables with data.

You can then use this to create the two SQLite3 database files that you will
need, db.sqlite3 and db_test.sqlite3 (although the latter, test database
will be blank and will not have the data in data.sql added).

First, open a terminal and change directory to that of this file, e.g. (where
my_app is the path to your application):

cd my_app/db/

and then running the create_db command as follows:

create_db

The db.rb file will load the correct database file depending on whether the
app is being run or tested by checking the “APP_ENV” key of the global “ENV”
hash. This key is set to “test” by the tests, so that the test database,
db_test.sqlite3 is used in preference to the normally used db.sqlite3.

If the relevant database file does not exist, none is loaded, although this will
cause an error if your app uses a model and is therefore expecting it to exist.

All activity is logged to db.log or db_test.log depending on what mode your
app is being run in.
