spec directory

Place your RSpec tests in this directory, organised into subdirectories.

Tests targetted at individual components of the system (e.g., routes of a
controller, methods of a class, etc.) can be put in directories called
controllers, helpers models etc., so it is clear which aspects of the application
they are aimed at.

Acceptance tests, which test the whole system should be placed in the
acceptance directory.
