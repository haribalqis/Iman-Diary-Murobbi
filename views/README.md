views directory
This is where your .erb (“embedded Ruby”) files go.

Remember that an .erb doesn’t have to be complete HTML files – they themselves can embed further .erb files that are commonly re-used fragments of pages, for example, headers and footers. For example:

<!-- common header file, in header.erb in this directory -->
erb :header

<!-- main body of page goes here -->

<!-- common header file, in footer.erb in this directory -->
erb :footer
